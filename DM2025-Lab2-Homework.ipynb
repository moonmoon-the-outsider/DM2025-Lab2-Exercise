    "\n",
    "The first goal of this project was to consolidate multiple scattered data sources into a single, clean DataFrame suitable for analysis and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing pipeline included the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merging multiple raw files into one unified DataFrame\n",
    "All text, labels, tags, and IDs from different files were merged into a single dataset to ensure consistent formatting and easier downstream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    <img src=\"./pics/tt_df.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Discarding the tag column\n",
    "Upon inspection, most tag information already appeared directly inside the text.\n",
    "To avoid duplicated semantic signals and reduce noise, the tag field was removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Aligning samples using id-based merging\n",
    "All data sources were merged using id as the primary key to guarantee correct pairing of text and labels across different files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generating a final analyzable dataframe\n",
    "After merging, the dataset contained consistent fields such as id, text, label, split, and later additional engineered features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Numerical encoding of target labels\n",
    "Since the original emotion categories were strings, a numerical label mapping was created (e.g., joy=5, anger=0).This enabled compatibility with machine learning classifiers and loss functions.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    label_id = { \"anger\": 0, \"disgust\": 1, \"fear\": 2,\n",
    "                \"sadness\": 3, \"surprise\": 4, \"joy\": 5 }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 Embedding Features  \n",
    "Multiple embedding models were used to extract semantic features, including:  \n",
    "1. `LLaMA-based embeddings`  \n",
    "2. `MPNet embeddings (final system’s strongest representation)`  \n",
    "3. `Other transformer embedding variants`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each sentence is converted into a dense vector (typically 768 dimensions), capturing contextual semantic meaning for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2 TF–IDF Features  \n",
    "Word-level TF–IDF (1–2 grams) was used to capture lexical information and important keywords.\n",
    "Character-level TF–IDF (3–5 grams) was added to better capture:  \n",
    "1. `slang`  \n",
    "2. `emojis`  \n",
    "3. `repeated characters`  \n",
    "4. `stylistic emotional patterns`  \n",
    "\n",
    "This resulted in a high-dimensional sparse matrix (20k–30k features), effectively complementing transformer embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3 Frequency-based Word Augmentation\n",
    "High-frequency and low-frequency words were analyzed for potential augmentation or removal.\n",
    "Experiments (e.g., augmentation, dropping frequent words, selective filtering) ultimately degraded model performance, as they disrupted semantic context.\n",
    "Therefore, these features were not included in the final model pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.4Tokenizer-based Features for Transformer Models\n",
    "Different transformer models use different tokenization strategies, so the following tokenizers were explored:\n",
    "1. `RoBERTa tokenizer`\n",
    "2. `DeBERTa tokenizer`\n",
    "3. `BERT tokenizer`\n",
    "4. `GPT/RoBERTa-family tokenizers`\n",
    "\n",
    "This allowed testing how tokenization impacts emotion granularity.\n",
    "Empirical results showed that RoBERTa achieved the strongest overall performance among the transformer models used.\n",

    "I implemented a transformer-based classification model built upon BERT-base-uncased with a custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classification head. The overall modeling workflow is summarized below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train–validation split\n",
    "The original training set was divided using a 75/25 ratio to obtain a validation subset while preserving label distribution. This allowed monitoring of model generalization during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tokenizer and Input Encoding\n",
    "Text data was processed using the BERT tokenizer with:   \n",
    "`max_length = 128`,  \n",
    "`padding to fixed length`,  \n",
    "`truncation for long sequences` Each input sample was converted into input_ids, attention_mask, and (when applicable) token_type_ids.\n",

    "3. Custom BERT-based Architecture\n",
    "A customized neural network was built by:  \n",
    "    * loading bert-base-uncased from HuggingFace  \n",
    "    * extracting the [CLS] token representation as the sentence embedding  \n",
    "    * adding a two-layer MLP head (768 → 256 → 6) with ReLU activation and dropout  \n",
    "    * applying a final softmax through a linear layer for the six emotion classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Training Strategy\n",
    "    * Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate 5e-5\n",
    "    * Loss: CrossEntropyLoss\n",
    "    * Batch size: 16\n",
    "    * Epochs: 3\n",
    "    * GPU acceleration when available\n",
    "The model was trained using mini-batch gradient descent with tqdm progress bars to track loss and accuracy in real time.\n",

    "5. Validation and Model Selection\n",
    "After each epoch, validation loss and accuracy were computed.\n",
    "The best model (highest validation accuracy) was saved as best_model.pth.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Final Prediction on Test Set\n",
    "The trained BERT model produced probability logits for the test set, followed by argmax to obtain class predictions.\n",
    "Predictions were mapped back to emotion labels:\n",
    "`anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, joy`\n",
    "and exported as submission.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add more detail in previous sections**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Mention Different Things You Tried\n",
    "I have attempted various methods to analyze and improve the dataset. The approaches I experimented with include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using LLaMA to generate sentence embeddings, followed by UMAP visualization.The results showed that most labels are difficult to distinguish from one another, especially the disgust and anger pair, which tend to cluster together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Examining high-frequency and low-frequency words to determine whether they could be used for data augmentation or removed during training.\n",
    "However, applying these strategies ultimately worsened the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Constructing a TF–IDF matrix to capture prominent words in the dataset.\n",
    "This representation was also used as input for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combining embeddings with TF–IDF features and training traditional machine-learning models such as KNN, Linear SVC, and LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using transformer-based models such as BERT and experimenting with different MLP architectures on top of BERT outputs.This included adjusting embedding sizes, varying input text formats, adding or removing class weights, and trying related models such as DeBERTa, GPT-based models, and RoBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on experiments using both weighted and unweighted training, I observed that models without sample weighting consistently performed better. I suspect this is because the hidden test distribution may preserve similar class frequencies (and therefore similar misclassification tendencies), making natural class imbalance preferable to forced rebalancing. In other words, enforcing balanced learning may harm performance if the test set itself is not balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the confusion matrix analysis, the model performs best on the joy category, but also exhibits a clear prediction bias toward joy and anger. As a result, many ambiguous or weakly emotional sentences are misclassified into these two categories. Meanwhile, the model shows limited capability in recognizing minority classes such as disgust, fear, and sadness. The surprise category is also frequently confused due to its intermediate emotional valence between positive and negative affect. Overall, the model is stable on high-frequency classes but struggles with fine-grained emotional distinctions, suggesting the need for stronger semantic representations, emotion lexicons, or more balanced training strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    <img src=\"./pics/confusion_m.png\" width=\"35%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regarding the transformer-based models tested, most of them achieved similar performance (around 0.65–0.68), except for variants where common words were removed—this severely damaged semantic structure and further degraded performance. Among the tested models, RoBERTa achieved the best overall results. When sample weighting was used, these models performed slightly better on low-frequency classes, so in the final model fusion stage, I assigned higher weights to their predictions on minority categories, which resulted in a small but consistent improvement in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I also examined several examples from the disgust class, which had the weakest performance. Many of these examples are inherently difficult—even humans may struggle to identify their emotions, as shown below...\n",
    "Many of these sentences contain sarcasm, fragmented expressions, ambiguous sentiment markers, or mixed emotional cues, making them inherently challenging for both machine learning\n",
    "```text\n",
    "    And I though Glory Kills were gruesome\n",
