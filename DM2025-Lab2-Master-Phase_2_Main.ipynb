      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "\n",
       "#### 1. Draw Phase (DP)\n",
       "*   **What Happens:** The turn player draws one card from their deck. (The player who goes first does **not** draw on their very first turn of the duel).\n",
       "*   **Timing Window:** Right after the card is drawn, the game state is \"open.\" This is the first chance in the turn for either player to activate \"Fast Effects.\" These are things like Trap Cards, Quick-Play Spell Cards, or a monster's Quick Effect (like my `Masked HERO Dark Law`'s hand-rip effect, if the opponent adds a card outside of drawing).\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. Standby Phase (SP)\n",
       "*   **What Happens:** This is a checkpoint phase. There's no built-in action here, but many card effects will trigger or require a cost to be paid \"during the Standby Phase.\"\n",
       "*   **Timing Window:** After any mandatory \"Standby Phase\" effects resolve, there's another window for both players to activate Fast Effects before moving to the Main Phase. It's a great time to use a card like `Infinite Impermanence` before your opponent can even start their main combos.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 3. Main Phase 1 (MP1)\n",
       "*   **What Happens:** This is your primary setup phase. The turn player can perform any of these actions in any order they choose:\n",
       "    *   **Normal Summon/Set:** Once per turn, you can summon a monster in face-up Attack Position or set it in face-down Defense Position. This is your one guaranteed summon.\n",
       "    *   **Special Summon:** You can Special Summon as many times as you have cards and effects that allow it (e.g., using `Fusion Destiny` to bring out `Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer`).\n",
       "    *   **Activate Spell/Trap Cards:** Flip face-down cards or play them from your hand.\n",
       "    *   **Set Spell/Trap Cards:** Place them face-down on the field.\n",
       "    *   **Change Monster Battle Positions:** You can change the position of any monster you control once per turn, provided it wasn't summoned this turn.\n",
       "    *   **Activate Monster Effects:** Use the Ignition Effects of your monsters on the field.\n",
       "*   **Timing Window:** The turn player has priority. Whenever they make a move (like a summon or activating a card), a window opens for the opponent to respond with a Fast Effect, which can start a Chain. This is the heart of the game's interaction.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 4. Battle Phase (BP)\n",
       "*   **What Happens:** This is where you attack your opponent's monsters and their Life Points. This entire phase is optional; you can go straight from MP1 to the End Phase if you want. The Battle Phase has its own crucial sub-steps:\n",
       "    *   **Start Step:** You announce you're entering the Battle Phase. Both players can activate Fast Effects here before any attacks are declared. This is a key timing for cards like `Evenly Matched`.\n",
       "    *   **Battle Step:** The turn player declares an attack with one of their monsters, choosing an opponent's monster as the target (or attacking directly if they have none). After the attack is declared, there's another window for Fast Effects (e.g., `Mirror Force`, `Forbidden Chalice`).\n",
       "    *   **Damage Step:** This is the most complex timing in the game. Only very specific cards can be activated here. It's broken down further:\n",
       "        1.  *Start of the Damage Step:* Cards that say \"At the start of the Damage Step\" activate.\n",
       "        2.  *Before Damage Calculation:* Most ATK/DEF modifying effects are used here (like `Honest`).\n",
       "        3.  *During Damage Calculation:* The math happens. Very few cards can be used now.\n",
       "        4.  *After Damage Calculation:* Effects that trigger from the battle resolve (like my `Elemental HERO Flame Wingman`'s burn effect). FLIP effects also activate here.\n",
       "        5.  *End of the Damage Step:* The monster destroyed by battle is sent to the Graveyard.\n",
       "    *   **End Step:** After all battles are finished, you announce you're ending the Battle Phase. There's one last chance for Fast Effects before moving on.\n",

       "*   **Why it's important:** You use this phase to set up your board after your attacks. For example, after clearing the opponent's field with my HEROes, I can use my remaining monsters in MP2 to Link Summon `Xtra HERO Cross Crusader` to prepare for my next turn. You can also set any Traps you drew for the turn to protect yourself.\n",

This can go back and forth until both players are done. (This is when `DPE` brings back a Destiny HERO from the grave).\n",
       "*   **Last Action:** After all effects have resolved, the turn player must check their hand size. If they have more than 6 cards, they must discard to the Graveyard until they have 6. This is the very last thing that happens before the turn officially passes to the opponent.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "**Note:** You might see an `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error when running the following code all at once, this is because the `current API Rate Limit handling cannot reliably find out how many requests we have left per minute` from cell to cell, there is no Gemini feature created for it to get the information from their servers. So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
